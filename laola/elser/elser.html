<H2><font color=#008000>Word convertress</font></H2>

<H4>Version 0.1.1 ALPHA from Apr/15/97</H4>

Elser is a program that actually was designed to convert Word documents
easily to HTML documents. Anyway, this is a pretty difficult task. So the
current release of Elser does many things, except such a conversion. Assume 
to see a very first result done on the way to understand Word and then to 
convert it.<p>

I decided to publish this anyway. I hope the distribution will offer hints 
to persons also researching on Word Document format. Further more I think,
the performance on macro and password tasks already is quite ok.<p>

<H4><font color=#7f007f>Available actions</font></H4>

<dl>
<dt>Elser -i {document(s)}
<dd>Informs shortly about the document. Details are:<br>
    <ul>
    <li><font color=#cf0000>word6, word7, word8</font><br>
        Word version used to create document.
    <li><font color=#cf0000>PW "Kohl muﬂ weg!"</font><br>
        Document was stored using password "Kohl muﬂ weg!"
    <li><font color=#cf0000>no macros</font><br>
        This document contains no macros and therefore no virus, too.
    <li><font color=#cf0000>no virus?, virus?, virus!?</font><br>
        Document might contain / contains probably / very probably contains
        a virus.
    <li><font color=#cf0000>template</font><br>
        Document is actually not a document, but a template. Templates
	and documents are nearly the same, but word stores macros in
        templates, only.
    <li><font color=#cf0000>fastsaved!</font><br>
        Document is stored in "FastSave" Format. This is bad.
    </ul>
<p>
<dt>Elser -D {document(s)}
<dd>Renames those macros, that could be executed automatically. Should be
    used mostly in conjunction with option -E, I suppose.
<p>
<dt>Elser -E {document(s)}
<dd>Word can store macros in a way that prevents from editing them. -E
    would make them editable again.
<p>
<dt>Elser -m {document(s)}
<dd>Lists all macros and menus included in the document. In the current
    state it doesn't show buttons, that could be installed by the document.
<p>
<dt>Elser -M #+ {document(s)}
<dd>Prints the code of all macros of document(s) to stdout. The output
    will be german. That's stupid if you have a non german Word Version,
    as your Word program will not understand this output. To create
    output according to your language, follow the instructions in Word 
    file <a href=word6/macro.dot>word6/macro.dot</a>.<p>
    If you have an English Word, you might look at Mike Janda's
    (<a href="mailto:mike.janda@mpcug.com">mike.janda@mpcug.com</a>)
    quick and fine DOS program 
    <a href=http://www.bocklabs.wisc.edu/~janda/programs.html>LWM</a>.
<p>
<dt>Elser -R {document(s)}
<dd>Removes the password protection from documents. This is a little bit
    <font color=#cf0000>dangerous</font>, as Elser not always gets
    the perfectly right key. Always keep a copy from the password protected 
    document until you are sure, that "elser -R" didn't crush the original.
<p>
<dt>Elser -Y #+ {document(s)}
<dd>Removes irreversible and definitely all macro information. Use this 
    if you really don't like to have any macro in a document. It does
    not only clean the macro code, but it also cleans the macro 
    definition section.
<p>
<dt>Elser -Y AutoExec {document(s)}
<dd>Would remove the macro code for macro "AutoExec". As Word decides not
    between lower and upper characters, this is same as e.g. "autoexec" 
    or "AuToExEc".
<p>
<p>

<p>
<dt>Elser -o macro12.txt -M #1,2 {document(s)}
<dd>Prints the code of macros number 1 and 2 to file "macro12.txt". Macro
    numbers are those showed with "elser -m".
<p>
</dl>

A last note to performance. As Perl normally is installed as interpretra, 
it lacks in speed at certain operations. Therefore decoding documents and
macros takes very long time. As decoding macros is done nearly always when
looking at documents, e.g. an "elser -i" really could take some time.
