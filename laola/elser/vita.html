<H4>Preface</H4>

Every year towards 20th of July media coverage in Germany is focussing
upon the resistance against government Adolf Hitler. At 07/20/1944 plan
"Walküre" should be executed. Hitler should be killed by a bomb attack, then
dictatorship should be overthrown to create a military dictatorship. But
after detonation only few revolution orders really was executed. The putsch
finally collapsed when Hitler at the same day reported about the attack in a
radio speech. The result was that putsch members, many of their families and
highhanded grabbed oppositionals was being murderered, ready supported by
german justice.<p>

This is how the picture of resistance is engraved on me thanks to my western
german biography. An attack of upright militaries, closely associated to the
name of general staff officer Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg.<p>

But of course not all putsch members had been militaries. And of course
all putsch members heavily plead for anticommunistic goals, so that of
course they did not cooperate with a major part of oppositional powers.
And of course the planned military dictatorship had nothing in common
with democracy. And of course the attack did not have any serious
effect on the survival of dictatorship. And isn't this strange?<p>

At the date of attack military defeat of Germany was quite obvious. Allied
soldiers had being landed successfully in Normandie. Stalingrad was
reconquered for one and a half year. Sovjet soldiers advanced irresistable
to the west. England was clearly superior in aerial warfare. Main parts of
infrastructure and arms industry was destroyed. From other European fascists
no military help was to expect. National debt was a catastrophy.<p>

Revolutions should be on daily agenda in such situations. But they did not.
The nonpersecuted part of german and germanized population in common now as
before trusted very much in the dictator. Attacks on nazis regularly
resulted in a rise of sympathie to the nazis. So even more important than
overthrowing the tyrann seemed to be to inform population and to mobilize
against Nazis; criminal Hitler then would have been prosecuted
automatically. So the strategy of many groups had been to organize a
broad social basis agains the Nazis via decentral alliances. In this way
resistance took place en detail and historically quite anonymous. And
it did not work.<p>

But what about Georg Elser? Like Stauffenberg he placed a bomb that
nearly killed Hitler. The bomb detonated at 8th of November 1939, thus
two month after start of attack against Poland and more than two years
before Hitler ordered to consequently murder all people counted to
jewish belief. But in contrast to Stauffenberg Elser was no military.
And in contrast to Stauffenberg he still is unknown. This, although
there are published a film from and with Klaus Maria Brandauer, some books
belonging to different genres and several smaller contributions. 
I wanted to support the discussion about Elser, for that when talking
about resistance not only military is meant, that after all also carried
the regime's atrocities.<p>

Following now some few information on Georg Elser and an attack
that killed eight persons and resulted in a big rise of sympathy 
to Hitler.<p>

<H4>Biography</H4>

<dl><dt><dd>
"Elser, Johann Georg (Jan/04/1903 - Apr/09/1945)<br>
Elser grew up in a württemberger workers family. 1917 he started an 
education as iron turner, cancelled it two years later and became
building and furniture joiner. Since 1925 he worked at a Konstanzer
watch plant, since 1930 at a similar company in Meersburg. 1932 he
returned to Königsbronn and build up a small joiners workshop. Since
1935 he earned money with casual jobs and since 1936 he worked at an
armature plant in Heidenheim/Württemberg. For a while he was closely
connected to Roter Frontkämpferbund, but soon he became a "lone wolf",
because he demanded decisive resistance against Hitler's taking over
of government. After Münchener Abkommen from autumn 1938, Elser decided
to perform violent resistance against NS-Regime, thus preventing the
break out of a certain expected world war. ..."<p>

<H4>Preparation of attack</H4>

<dl><dt><dd>
"... During my stay in München from 5th of August to 6th of November 1939
I have been in the hall of Bürgerbräukeller altogether about 30 to 35
times.<p>
When I had put in order my clothing, arranged my tools, as far as I already
took them with me for use at first time, I went probably at the 3rd or 4th
night after my arrival in München on work in the hall. At the days when at
night I worked in Bürgerbräukeller, I always went at 8pm to 10pm into
parlor of Bürgerbräukeller to eat my evening meal. I regularly sat down
and have been served by waitress B. I ate a la card and always drank a 
glass of beer. ... About 10pm I always paid. Then I left the parlor,
betook myself through the wardrobe room into the unlocked hall, went
from there over the rear staircase to the gallery, went along there to
the rearmost front and hided there in a broom-room, that is placed
beside the backward entry to the gallery and is covered only by a
spanish wall. In this room empty cardboard boxes have been. Similar
cardboard boxes I have seen in the shooting gallery of Bürgerbräukeller,
when I have been there in October sometimes sundays on dancing parties.<p>

If entering of the hall once had been seen I cannot say. In the beginning
emergency lights was on, later, after begin of war, there was no more
illumination switched on. At this time there had been only light coming 
from kitchen and wardrobe room. In the mentioned hiding-place I stayed
until the hall was being locked. This had been always in the time
between 10.30pm to 11.30pm. Before the hall was locked, Ms. M. - this
is the woman I'm aquainted with, selling cigars in Bürgerbräukeller - fed
the there dwelling cats. She did not enter the gallery while this. After
this it was locked three times, as far I heard from the noise, only
the locking of main entry took place. If the emergency exit to the garden
was locked, I do not know.<p>

After the hall had been locked I went from my hiding-place directly
to the pillar, where I undertook installation of my apparatus. I have
been staying just here and there for a short time in the hiding-place,
to make sure factual of nobody being in the hall.<p>

I always stayed in the hall for the whole night. The hall was opened again
at the time between 7am and 8am. From a person I never saw the halls entry 
and the emergency exit to the garden was opened from wardrobe room, that
is beside the tavern. My works I always finished between 2am and 3am,
subsequently I stayed until leaving the hall in the already mentioned 
hiding-place, where also a chair has been. There I dozed until leaving
the hiding-place. In August 1939 after unlocking the hall I sometimes left 
it through the emergency exit to the garden. With begin of war a civil air
guard had been placed to Bürgerbräukeller, that was accommodated in
Alt-Münchener hall and that in the morning at about 6.30am to 7.30am
cooked coffee in the little kitchen, that is near the stage in the hall.
How many men was compositing this guard, I cannot specify. From when the 
civil air guard was moving in into Bürgerbräukeller, the mentioned emergency
exit was opened already at 6am from a person not known to me. From then on
I left the Bürgerbräukeller already at 6.30am. If in August I have been seen
by somebody when leaving the hall I don't know. I did see, that at this
time in garden of Bürgerbräukeller an old man was staying, who kept in
order the garden, but if this one was watching me, I don't know. Certain
I know, that from September on when leaving the emergency exit I have been 
seen by men of the civil air guard. But I have been never stopped by
them. I don't know these men, also I am not able, to give a description
of these men. When leaving the hall I did not take any special care, to 
not somehow behave suspicious. I entered and left the hall only in the
specified way, I never climbed into the building. ...<p>

I wore at that time throughout a dark blue worsted suit with long trousers,
black halfshoes and a coffeebrown pullover. ..."<p>

<H4>Attack</H4>
<dl><dt><dd>
"Already at about 6pm at 8th of November hall and gallery of "Löwenbräu"
was crowded, from prominence Bouhler, Himmler, Rosenberg, Frank, Goebbels,
Ribbentrop and Sepp Dietrich was present. The Badenweiler Marsch was
played and the "Blood flag" was carried in, then the Führer came, jubilation
arose among the threethousand. Although at former times Hitler used to hold
his big speech at about 8.30pm and to quit it at about 10pm, because of the
few available time begin was advanced for half an hour. With stroke of the 
clock at 8pm Hitler came in, held his speech and finished it at about
9.10pm. At about 9.20pm the explosion ensued, and the falling ceiling killed
eight old figthers (one of these died later in hospital) and injured more
then sixty." [Other sources say, one of the eight victims had been a
waitress]<p>

<H4>Murder</H4>

<dl><dt><dd>
"Considering the lean examination results and lacking proofs for the
precipitate assertion, foreign secret services were at the bottom of the
attack, during the war one dispensed with a big process against Elser. When
early in 1945 end of Reich was close, Gestapo-Chef Heinrich Müller picked
up via Himmler Hitlers decision "about our special custody prisoner
&gt;Eller&lt;", which had been the cover name when Elser was kept. At 5th
of April 1945 he wrote to camp commander of Dachau, SS-Obersturmbannführer 
Weiter:<p>

"At on of the next terror attacks against München resp. against the
surrounding of Dachau pretendedly 'Eller' had an deadly accident. I ask,
to liquidate for this purpose 'Eller' in an absolute unobtrusive way
when such a situation is given... The execution report about this to me
would be then: 'At ... on the occasion of the terror attack on ... among
others custody prisoner 'Eller' was injured deadly.""<p>

Hitler, Piper Verlag, München, p 305f. Translated by myself.)

At Apr/09/1945 in concentration camp Dachau Elser was put to death.<p>
