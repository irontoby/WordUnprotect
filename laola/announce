Hello,

Just finished: a new distribution of LAOLA. Laola contains source codes 
and information about the so called "structured storage" format, that is
the binary format of OLE documents. 

It can be found at:

   http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~schwartz/pmh/laola.html

The most important changes are dealing with Word 6 document format. Laola
now includes a very first approach of a publically specification of Word's
binary document format. Further more it includes the new program "Elser". 
Elser is dealing heavily with the document format of Word 6, especially:

   * decodes Word documents (even most documents with no text at all)
   * lists macros and macro codes
   * can delete single macros or all macro information
   * renames auto executable macros and makes them editable

Unfortunately I didn't make it until now to implement a nice html conversion. 
May be you will like to hear anyway, that I improved the program "lhalw" a 
little bit. It now can convert "fast saved" word documents to text, also.

Regards,

Martin
