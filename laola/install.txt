## Tips to install LAOLA and Elser
##

Install Automatically

If you like to install Laola automatically, use the program "install".
Simply start it with "perl install". Install will ask you, if all 
parameters are correct, before it does something. Install has some 
options, "perl install -h" showed them.


Install Manually

If you like to install Laola by hand, you have to copy some 
files including their directories to your favorite perl library 
directory. They are denoted by the hash array %lib_files in file 
"install".


Notes for Unix (Admin)

If you administrate a Unix system and want to install Laola for all
userEsses, start the install program with the command line option "-g". If
you have different perl versions, like a 4er and a 5er, prefer version 4.
Note that the executables will be called with the last perl version, that 
you used to install.


Notes for Unix (UserEss)

If you use a Unix system and you want to install Laola just privately,
assure to have your $ExecutePath (s.b.) before the /usr/bin path in 
your PATH environment variable. Otherwise it could happen, that you run 
the global program executables with your local Laola library files, and
this could be messy.


What to do on Errors

If this install program reports errors, try to apply manual changes
to file "install".


Yours, Martin
